REACT - https://reactjs.org/

WHO? created by an engineer at FB and is maintained by a team at Facebook (Meta)

WHAT? a library for JavaScript 

WHY? easier and less tedious to write than Vanilla JS and very very popular. Allows us to organize/modularize/reuse our code. Makes it very readable and thus easier to debug!

VERY POPULAR:

to install, we use this command in our terminal: npx create-react-app <name-of-app>

Why we don't worry about npm audit messages: https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/

JSX - looks like HTML but is React's syntactic sugar that compiles to HTML

Babel: middleware tool that compiles our code (instead of the browser doing it) - this comes built in with create-react-app, along with many other dependencies/code bundles.

We will use whiteboarding apps going forward to map our component hierarchy. I recommend Miro or Excalidraw but I'm sure there are others.
